Modern C++ examples
===================

Are you looking for a collection of short snippets of modern C++ code
covering features in C++11 and beyond? Of course you are! As I'm always
learning C++ myself, I wanted to put out simple examples of each of the
main features of the language. You can build each example individually
or as a whole. Please let me know if this is useful to anyone or if
there are any areas you want covered.
